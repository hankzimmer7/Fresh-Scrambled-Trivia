## Description

This trivia game asks the player a series of multiple-choice questions. The game asks the user one question at a time, and the player may answer by clicking on one of the displayed answer choice buttons. The game allows the player a set amount of time to answer each question.

Once the player has selected an answer, the game displays whether the answer was incorrect and reveals the correct answer. If the player does not select an answer within the time limit, the game also reveals the correct answer, but counts the question as unanswered.

Once all of the questions have been answered, the game shows a results page with the total number of correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions.
